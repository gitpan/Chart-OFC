NAME
    Chart::OFC - Generate data files for use with Open Flash Chart

SYNOPSIS
        use Chart::OFC; # loads all the other classes

        my $set = Chart::OFC::Dataset->new( values => [ 1..10 ] );
        my $pie = Chart::OFC::Pie->new( title   => 'Pie!',
                                        dataset => $set,
                                        labels  => [ 'a'..'j' ],
                                      );

        print $pie->as_ofc_data();

DESCRIPTION
    This class lets you generate data for the Open Flash Chart library. OFC
    produces very attractive charts, but it's data format is byzantine and
    hard to understand. This library lets you generate that data with a high
    level API.

    OFC can display pie charts, lines and/or bars on a grid, and area charts
    on a grid.

    If you haven't explored OFC yet, you might want to stop now and go the
    OFC home page at http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart/. There are
    many examples of what it can do with OFC there, and seeing them will
    help you understand exactly what kind of charts you want to generate
    with this library.

    Also note that this library simply generates data for OFC. You still
    need to embed the OFC flash in something and feed it the data to
    actually make a chart. This library does not generate Flash or HTML or
    anything like that.

    This library was tested with OFC 1.9.7, and follows the format defined
    for that version. The OFC zip file is included in this distribution's
    tarball, under the ofc directory.

  Classes
    The functionality for generating charts is split across a number of
    classes, each of which encapsulates one piece of a chart.

   Datasets
    Each data set represents one chunk of data to be displayed on your
    chart. There are a number of dataset subclasses for representing data in
    different formats (lines, bars, etc). You can also use the dataset base
    class, "Chart::OFC::Dataset", when creating a pie chart.

    The dataset classes provided are:

    *   Chart::OFC::Dataset

        The base class for all datasets. It has no formatting, and can only
        be used with pie charts.

    *   Chart::OFC::Dataset::Bar

    *   Chart::OFC::Dataset::FadeBar

    *   Chart::OFC::Dataset::OutlinedBar

    *   Chart::OFC::Dataset::GlassBar

    *   Chart::OFC::Dataset::3DBar

    *   Chart::OFC::Dataset::SketchBar

        Formats your data as a set of bars. There are many different styles
        of bars.

    *   Chart::OFC::Dataset::Line

    *   Chart::OFC::Dataset::LineWithDots

        Formats your data as a line, with optional dots marking each value.

    *   Chart::OFC::Dataset::Area

        Like a line with dots, but this dataset also fills in the area
        between the line and the X axis with a color.

   Axes and Axis Labels
    When you are creating a non-pie chart, you will want to create an X and
    Y axis for the chart. These are represented by the "Chart::OFC::XAxis"
    and "Chart::OFC::YAxis" classes.

    These classes in turn can take a "Chart::OFC::AxisLabel" class to define
    the label for the entire label.

   Grid Charts
    A grid chart can contain any number of datasets, in any combination of
    bars and lines.

   Pie Charts
    A pie chart displays a single dataset, with each value as a pie slice.

  Colors
    Many attributes in different classes expect a color. Colors can be
    provided as an RGB hex string with a leading "#" symbol, or as color
    names. Names are translated into RGB by use of the
    "Graphics::ColorNames" module, using the "X" scheme. See that module's
    docs for more details.

  Opacity
    Several classes accept an opacity value for an attribute. This should be
    a value from 0 (completely transparent) to 100 (completely opaque).

ATTRIBUTES
    This class has a number of attributes which may be passed to the "new()"
    method.

  title
    This is shown as the title of the chart.

    This attribute is optional.

  title_style
    This should be a chunk of CSS specifying attributes that apply to text,
    such as "font-size", "color", etc.

    This defaults to the string "font-size: 25px". Without a default
    specifying a sane size, the default size OFC uses seems to 1px or so.

  tool_tip
    This defines how tool tips are generated for data points. It uses a
    simple templating language. See
    http://teethgrinder.co.uk/open-flash-chart/gallery-tool-tip.php for
    details.

    This attribute is optional.

  bg_color
    The background color for the chart and surrounding text.

    This attribute is optional.

METHODS
    All of the above named may be accessed as read-only accessors on an
    object.

    This class also provide several additional methods.

  as_ofc_data
    Returns a textual representation of the chart suitable for delivering to
    OFC.

ROLES
    This class does the "Chart::OFC::Role::OFCDataLines" role.

TODO
    This distribution does not yet support all of the features of OFC.

    There are a few items left to do, notably grid charts with 2 Y axes, and
    background images.

    There are some new chart types in OFC 1.9.5 which are not supported.

    It would also be nice to generate embeddable Javascript for populating
    charts, since this lets you create a chart without making an additional
    server request for the data.

    Patches are welcome.
