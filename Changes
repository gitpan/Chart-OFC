0.06   2008-02-24

- Fix test failures with most recent Moose.


0.05   2008-01-25

- Fixed axis_color for Chart::OFC::XAxis color. Setting this caused an
  exception when you later called as_ofc_data() on your
  chart. Reported by Ovid. RT #32576.


0.04   2008-01-19

* This release requires Open Flash Chart 1.9.6 in order to function
  100% properly. Use it with older versions at your own risk of bugs.

- OFC 1.9.6 allows commas in text to be escaped so that they do not
  interfere with the data formatting (which is
  comma-separated). Chart::OFC now does this escaping.

- Allow Line datasets to contain undef in the values array. These will
  simply be skipped in the resulting line. Based on a patch from Brett
  Gardner.

- Fixed a doc error that set Dataset was a subclass of a nonexistent
  class. Reported by Ron Savage. RT #32113.

- Added Chart::OFC::Dataset::SketchBar to support the new sketch bar
  style in OFC 1.9.6.


0.03   2007-12-18

- Previous releases were missing a prereq declaration for
  List::MoreUtils.

- No code changes in this release.


0.02   2007-11-16

- This release is identical to 0.01, but should hide my monkey patch
  to Graphics::ColorNames from PAUSE.


0.01   2007-11-16

- First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
