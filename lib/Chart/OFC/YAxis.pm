=head1 NAME

Chart::OFC::YAxis - Y axis for grid charts

=head1 VERSION

version 0.11

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents the Y axis for a grid chart.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

This class is a subclass of C<Chart::OFC::Axis> and accepts all of
that class's attribute. It has several attributes of its own which may
be passed to the C<new()> method.

Note that because its label is display vertically, Unicode characters
in the label will not display correctly, according to the OFC docs.

=head2 min

This is the minimum value to show on the Y axis. It must be a number.

Defaults to 0.

=head2 max

This is the maximum value to show on the Y axis. It must be a number.

This attribute is required.

=head2 small_tick_size

The size of a small tick, in pixels.

Defaults to 5.

=head2 large_tick_size

The size of a large tick, in pixels.

Defaults to 10.

=head2 label_steps

Show a label every N values.

This attribute is required.

Note that the definition of this attribute is different than how OFC
defines it, but is consistent with the same attribute for the X axis
(unlike OFC).

=head1 ROLES

This class does the C<Chart::OFC::Role::OFCDataLines> role.
