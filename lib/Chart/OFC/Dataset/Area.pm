=head1 NAME

Chart::OFC::Dataset::Area - A dataset represented as a line with a filled area

=head1 VERSION

version 0.11

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $bars = Chart::OFC::Dataset::Area->new( values     => \@numbers,
                                             dot_size   => 3,
                                             opacity    => 60,
                                             color      => 'blue',
                                             fill_color => 'purple',
                                             label      => 'Daily Sales in $',
                                             text_size  => 12,
                                           );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class contains values to be charted as a dotted line with a
filled area between the line and the X axis.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

This class has several attributes which may be passed to the C<new()>
method.

It is a subclass of C<Chart::OFC::Dataset::Line> and accepts all of
that class's attributes as well as its own.

=head2 opacity

This defines how opaque the bars are. When they are moused over, they
become fully opaque.

Defaults to 80 (percent).

=head2 fill_color

The color used to fill the area between the line and the X axis.

This attribute is optional. If it is not provided, then OFC uses the
color of the line itself (set with the C<color> attribute).

=head2 dot_size

The size of the dots in pixels.

Defaults to 5.

=head1 ROLES

This class does the C<Chart::OFC::Role::OFCDataLines> role.
