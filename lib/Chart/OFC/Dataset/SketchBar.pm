=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $bars = Chart::OFC::Dataset::SketchBar->new( values     => \@numbers,
                                                  opacity    => 60,

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class contains values to be charted as bars on a grid chart. The
bars are filled with the specified color in the style of a child's
crayon drawing.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

This class is a subclass of C<Chart::OFC::Dataset::OutlinedBar> and
accepts all of that class's attributes. It has one attribute of its own.

=head2 randomness

This is an integer (0 or greater) defining how random the sketch style
is. The greater it is the more random the look. The default value is 3.

=head1 ROLES

This class does the C<Chart::OFC::Role::OFCDataLines> role.
