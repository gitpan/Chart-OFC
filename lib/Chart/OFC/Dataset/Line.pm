=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class contains values to be charted as a line on a grid chart.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

This class has several attributes which may be passed to the C<new()>
method.

It is a subclass of C<Chart::OFC::Dataset> and accepts all of that
class's attributes as well as its own.

=head2 values

For this class, the values array may contain some undefined
values. These are simply skipped in the resulting chart.

=head2 links

Just as with values, this may contain some undefined values.

=head2 width

The width of the line in pixels.

Defaults to 2.

=head2 color

The color of the line, and of the text in the chart key, if a label is
specified.

Defaults to #999999 (medium grey).

=head2 label

If provided, this will be shown as part of the chart key.

This attribute is optional.

=head2 text_size

This is the size of the text in the key.

Defaults to 10 (pixels).

=head1 ROLES

This class does the C<Chart::OFC::Role::OFCDataLines> role.
