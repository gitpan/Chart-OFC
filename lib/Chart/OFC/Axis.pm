# ABSTRACT: Base class for axis classes

=head1 NAME

Chart::OFC::Axis - Base class for axis classes

=head1 VERSION

version 0.11

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is the base class for the X and Y axis classes. It provides
several attributes which are shared between these two subclasses.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

This class has a number of attributes which may be passed to the
C<new()> method.

=head2 text_size

The size of tick labels for the axis, in pixels.

Defaults to 10.

=head2 text_color

The default color of tick labels.

Defaults to "#784016".

=head2 axis_color

The color of the axis line itself

This attribute is optional.

=head2 grid_color

The color of grid lines for this axis.

This attribute is optional.

=head2 axis_label

This is the label for the axis as a whole. This can be either a
string, a hash reference or an a C<Chart::OFC::AxisLabel> object.

If given a string or hash reference, the constructor will create a new
C<Chart::OFC::AxisLabel> object. If just a string is given, this is
used as the label text.

This attribute is required.

=head1 ROLES

This class does the C<Chart::OFC::Role::OFCDataLines> role.
